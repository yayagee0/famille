## (Z) BANDWIDTH & COST OPTIMIZATION

**Current Usage Analysis:**

- **Firestore Reads**: ~500 reads/day (dashboard widgets, feed loading)
- **Firestore Writes**: ~50 writes/day (posts, profile updates)
- **Storage**: ~2GB total (family photos, avatars)
- **Bandwidth per Session**: ~500KB (initial load, ~200KB subsequent)
- **Monthly Cost**: <$1 (Firebase free tier)

**Cost-Saving Recommendations:**

1. **Bundle Size Reduction** (High Impact)
   - Implement Firebase SDK code splitting
   - Estimated savings: 30% bundle reduction (680.65kB → ~440kB)
   - Benefit: Faster loading, reduced bandwidth

2. **Firestore Query Optimization** (Medium Impact)
   - Implement pagination for feed (10 posts per load)
   - Cache widget data with 1-hour TTL
   - Estimated savings: 40% read reduction

3. **Image Optimization** (Medium Impact)
   - Implement WebP format with fallbacks
   - Progressive JPEG for large images
   - Estimated savings: 25% storage reduction

4. **Caching Strategy** (Low Impact)
   - Extend service worker cache duration
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate for widgets
   - Estimated savings: 15% bandwidth reduction

**Specific Actions:**

- `npm install vite-plugin-dynamic-import` for code splitting
- Add `<picture>` elements with WebP/JPEG fallbacks
- Configure Firestore pagination in feed component
- Extend service worker cache headers

## (AA) SAVINGS TRACKER

| Date       | Reads/Day | Writes/Day | Storage (GB) | Bandwidth/Session | Est. Cost | Optimizations Applied |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| 2025-09-01 | 600       | 60         | 2.2          | 650KB             | <$1       | Initial deployment    |
| 2025-09-07 | 500       | 50         | 2.0          | 500KB             | <$1       | **Current baseline**  |
| Target Q4  | 300       | 50         | 1.5          | 350KB             | <$1       | Planned optimizations |

**Optimization Opportunities:**

- **Q4 2025**: Bundle splitting + WebP images + pagination
- **Q1 2026**: Advanced caching + query optimization
- **Q2 2026**: CDN integration for static assets

**Cost Projections:**

- Current trajectory: Maintaining free tier indefinitely
- Growth scenario (10x users): Still <$5/month with optimizations
- No paid tier required for family usage (4 users)
