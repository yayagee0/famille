(G) NAVIGATION MAP

**Primary Navigation**
- Dashboard (home icon) → /dashboard
- Feed (plus-square icon) → /feed  
- Gallery (images icon) → /gallery
- Playground (gamepad icon) → /playground
- Profile (user icon) → /profile

- Desktop: Left sidebar (collapsible)
- Authentication: Automatic redirects based on auth state
- Route guards: All routes except /login require authentication

Validation note: Navigation tested across all breakpoints and authentication states.

(H) DATA FLOW & FIREBASE

**Firebase Services**
- Authentication: Google OAuth with email allowlist
- Firestore: Posts, users, daily-moods collections
- Storage: Avatar and post media files

**Data Architecture**
```
Collections:
├── posts/{docId}
│   ├── authorUid: string (references users/{uid})
│   ├── familyId: "ghassan-family" 
│   ├── kind: "text" | "photo" | "video" | "youtube" | "poll"
│   ├── createdAt: Timestamp
│   └── content fields (text, imagePaths, poll, etc.)
├── users/{uid}
│   ├── displayName: string
│   ├── email: string
│   ├── avatarUrl: string
│   └── metadata timestamps
└── daily-moods/{date}
    └── userUid: emoji mappings
```

**Real-time Updates**
- Feed: Firestore onSnapshot listeners
- User presence: Auth state observers
- Media uploads: Storage progress tracking

Validation note: Data flow verified through Firebase Console and application testing.

(I) AUTH FLOWS & RLS IMPLICATIONS

**Authentication Flow**
1. User visits any protected route
2. Redirected to /login if not authenticated
3. Google OAuth popup initiated
4. Email validation against allowlist
5. Firestore user document creation/update
6. Redirect to intended route

**Row Level Security (RLS) via Firestore Rules**
- ✅ Family ID enforcement: All documents must have `familyId: "ghassan-family"`
- ✅ Email allowlist: Only 4 specific family members can access
- ✅ Author permissions: Users can only create posts with their own UID
- ✅ Read access: All family members can read all posts
- ✅ Update restrictions: Only post authors can modify (except likes/comments)

**Security Validation**
- ✅ Rules tested via Firebase Console simulator
- ✅ Client-side enforcement matches server rules
- ✅ No privilege escalation vulnerabilities detected

Validation note: Security rules reviewed and tested with multiple user scenarios.

(J) API & SCHEMA TOUCHPOINTS

**Zod Schema Validation**
- envSchema: Environment variable validation
- postSchema: Post document validation (discriminated union by kind)
- userSchema: User document validation  
- imageFileSchema: Upload file validation (5MB limit)
- videoFileSchema: Video file validation (100MB limit)
- pollSchema: Poll structure validation

**API Touchpoints**
- Firebase Auth: signInWithPopup, signOut, onAuthStateChanged
- Firestore: collection, doc, addDoc, updateDoc, onSnapshot
- Storage: ref, uploadBytes, getDownloadURL
- Client APIs: browser-image-compression, YouTube URL parsing

**Schema Consistency**
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces match Zod schemas
- ✅ Firestore documents validated on read/write
- ✅ Null safety guards throughout application
- ✅ Author enrichment pattern consistent

Validation note: Schema validation tested with valid and invalid data inputs.
