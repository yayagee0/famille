## (Z) BANDWIDTH & COST
- Firestore: ~350 reads/day  
- Storage: ~120MB  
- Bandwidth: ~1.2MB/session  

**Ideas to Save**
1. Use WebP/AVIF for images (40–60% savings).  
2. Batch Firestore reads (cut ~100/day).  
3. Limit videos to 720p (save ~70%).

## (AA) SAVINGS TRACKER

---

## (AB) SIMPLICITY
- Code size small, easy to read.  
- ⚠️ Some Firebase logic a bit wordy → could wrap in helper utils.  

---

## (AC) DOCS & NOTES
- ✅ README + AGENTS.md exist.  
- ⚠️ No clear backup/restore guide yet.  
- Suggest: write **Setup.md** with install + recovery steps.  

---

## (AD) RECOVERY
- ✅ Git commits healthy.  
- ⚠️ No Firestore/Storage exports yet.  
- Suggest: monthly backup with `gcloud export`.

## (AE) FAMILY FEEDBACK
- Yahya → loves Playground.  
- Yazid → Gallery navigation clunky.

**Next Sprint Ideas**
1. Fix Gallery nav.
