- **E2E tests**: Located in `tests/e2e/` using Playwright
- **Test configuration**: 
  - `vitest.config.ts` for unit tests
  - `playwright.config.ts` for E2E tests

### Continuous Integration

- Unit tests run on all pushes and pull requests
- E2E tests run on pushes to main and pull requests
- Test artifacts are uploaded on failures for debugging

## üîí Security

### Authentication

- Only allows Google OAuth authentication
- Email allowlist restricts access to specific family members configured in environment variables
- Firebase Auth handles all authentication logic

### Database Rules

- Firestore rules enforce `familyId` matching your configured family ID
- Users can only create posts with their own `uid`
- Read access limited to allowlisted users
- Update permissions restricted to post authors (except likes/comments)

### Storage Rules

- Users can only upload to their own folders
- Read access limited to allowlisted users
- Automatic file validation and compression

## üì± Routes

- `/` - Root route (redirects to dashboard or login)
- `/login` - Google OAuth authentication
- `/dashboard` - Family activity overview and statistics
- `/feed` - Multi-format family feed with post creation
- `/profile` - Profile management and avatar upload

## üß© Core Components

### `src/lib/Nav.svelte`

Responsive navigation with sidebar (desktop) and bottom navigation (mobile).

### `src/lib/FeedUpload.svelte`

Multi-format post composer supporting:

- Text posts
- Photo uploads (with compression)
- Video uploads
- YouTube link sharing
- Poll creation

### `src/lib/firebase.ts`

## üé® Styling

- **TailwindCSS v4** with modern CSS features
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- **Consistent color scheme** with indigo primary colors
- **Accessible** design with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## üìä Unified Firebase Schema

### Posts Collection (`/posts/{postId}`)

```typescript
{
  authorUid: string;           // References users/{uid} - unified approach
  familyId: string;            // Your configured family identifier
  kind: "text" | "photo" | "video" | "youtube" | "poll";
  text: string;                // Post content
  createdAt: Timestamp;        // Server timestamp
  likes: string[];             // Array of user UIDs
  comments: Comment[];         // Array of comment objects

  // Media fields (optional)
  imagePath?: string;          // Single image URL
  imagePaths?: string[];       // Multiple image URLs
  videoPath?: string;          // Single video URL
  youtubeId?: string;          // YouTube video ID

  // Poll fields (optional)
  poll?: {
    title: string;
    options: Array<{
      text: string;
      votes: string[];          // Array of user UIDs who voted
    }>;
  };
}
```

### Users Collection (`/users/{uid}`)

```typescript
{
  uid: string;                 // Firebase Auth UID
  displayName: string | null;  // User's display name
  email: string;               // User's email
  avatarUrl?: string | null;   // Profile picture URL
  photoURL?: string | null;    // Alias for avatarUrl (Firebase Auth compatibility)
  createdAt?: Timestamp;       // Account creation
  lastLoginAt?: Timestamp;     // Last sign-in time
  lastUpdatedAt?: Timestamp;   // Profile update time
}
```

### Schema Features

- **Author Enrichment**: Posts store only `authorUid`, author data retrieved from `users/{uid}`
- **Zod Validation**: All schemas validated with discriminated unions
- **Null Safety**: Comprehensive null checks throughout components
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore listeners with automatic author enrichment

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on git push

### Firebase Hosting

1. **Install Firebase CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Initialize Firebase Hosting**:

   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```

3. **Build and deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

### Other Platforms

The app is built as a standard SvelteKit application and can be deployed to:

- Netlify
- Railway
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Any Node.js hosting provider

## üîß Configuration

### Email Allowlist

To modify the allowed family members, update the `VITE_ALLOWED_EMAILS` environment variable with comma-separated email addresses.

### Firebase Configuration

Update the Firebase configuration in `.env` with your own project details.

### Family ID

The `VITE_FAMILY_ID` should be set to your family identifier and must match the enforcement in Firestore rules.

### Birthdays Configuration

Family member birthdays are configured in the `VITE_BIRTHDAYS` environment variable as a JSON map with email keys and ISO date values.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

- Ensure Google OAuth is properly configured in Firebase Console
- Verify the allowed emails are correct in the environment variables
- Check that the Firebase configuration is correct

### Upload Issues

- Verify Firebase Storage rules are deployed
- Ensure CORS is configured for the storage bucket
- Check that file sizes are within limits (5MB for images)

### Build Issues

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear the build cache: `rm -rf .svelte-kit && npm run build`
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run check`
