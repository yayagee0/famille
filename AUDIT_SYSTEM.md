# Family Hub Audit System

This document explains the comprehensive audit system for Family Hub that generates detailed APP_STATUS_REVIEW.md reports following strict audit rules.

## Quick Start

Run a complete audit:

```bash
npm run audit
```

This will generate a fresh `APP_STATUS_REVIEW.md` with all required sections A-AE.

## Audit Rules Overview

The audit system follows strict rules to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### Basic Requirements

- âœ… Always starts with **ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Summary**
- âœ… Includes **all sections (Aâ€“AE)** in order
- âœ… Uses **N/A** when nothing to report
- âœ… Uses **"Validation note: checked, no change"** when nothing changed
- âœ… Fresh **UTC timestamp** (ISO8601 format)

### Evidence Requirements

- âœ… **â‰¥15 evidence entries** each run
- âœ… Covers: code refs, configs, build logs, tests, linting, deps, cost/bandwidth, backups
- âœ… Shows file/line + tool/command used
- âœ… Always ends with **Evidence Index** section

### Key Metrics Tracked

- Build time, bundle size (raw & gzipped)
- Lines of code, routes, components
- Test pass rate, accessibility warnings
- Security vulnerabilities, dependency count
- Disk size, Lighthouse score equivalent
- **Bandwidth KPIs**: upload avg, download avg, cache ratio
- **Cost KPIs**: Firestore reads/writes/day, Storage GB, Auth users
- **Backup KPIs**: last backup date, repo commits
- **Family KPIs**: feedback count, satisfaction notes

- What features do they request?
- Satisfaction tracking over time

## Technical Implementation

### Audit Generator (`scripts/audit-generator.ts`)

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Automated metrics**: Build time, bundle size, LOC, test results
- **Evidence collection**: Minimum 15 items per run
- **Fresh timestamps**: ISO8601 UTC format
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for build failures

### Integration

- **npm script**: `npm run audit`
- **CI/CD ready**: Can be integrated into automated workflows
- **File output**: Overwrites `APP_STATUS_REVIEW.md`

## Usage Examples

### Daily Audit

```bash
npm run audit
git add APP_STATUS_REVIEW.md
git commit -m "Daily audit: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

### Pre-deployment Audit

```bash
npm run build && npm run test:run && npm run audit
```

### Performance Tracking

The audit automatically tracks:

- Bundle size changes over time
- Test coverage evolution
- Cost optimization progress
- Family satisfaction trends

## Customization

### Adding Evidence Items

Edit `scripts/audit-generator.ts` in the `addEvidence()` calls to include additional validation steps.

### Modifying Sections

Each section is generated in the `generateMarkdown()` method. Add or modify sections while maintaining A-AE ordering.

### Metrics Expansion

The `gatherMetrics()` method can be extended to collect additional automated metrics.

## Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks

- Review audit output for trends
- Update family feedback section
- Check cost optimization suggestions

### Monthly Tasks

- Archive old APP_STATUS_REVIEW.md versions
- Update dependency risk assessments
- Review and implement suggested optimizations

### Quarterly Tasks

- Major audit rule updates
- Family satisfaction survey
- Security rule review (as per AGENTS.md)

This comprehensive audit system ensures consistent, thorough monitoring of the Family Hub platform while maintaining the hobby-friendly, family-focused approach outlined in the project requirements.
